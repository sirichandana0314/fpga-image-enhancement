Simulation Results – Pixel Observations

Input RGB: R=100, G=150, B=200
Grayscale Output: Correct weighted conversion
Brightness Output: Increased by offset with saturation handling
Threshold Output: Binary output (0 or 255) as expected
Downsample Output: Pixel retained at defined clock interval
Contrast Stretch Output: Mid-range values expanded to full range
Smoothing Output: Reduced abrupt intensity variations

Input RGB: R=250, G=120, B=60
Observed similar correct behavior across all modules.

All outputs remained within valid 0–255 range.
No overflow or underflow observed.
